  <h1>What is this?</h1>
  <p>
  This environment is meant to be suitable for training classes, code dojos, and individual practice for Scala programmers. If you configured the environment at the request of a training class instructor, then he/she has also given you one or more Github repository URLs for projects that will be used in the training class. Please clone and verify those projects before the class begins.

<h3>Manual installation steps</h3>
